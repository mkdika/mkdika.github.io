Hi, My name is **Maikel Chandika**

I'm a software engineer and Open Source Software enthusiast base in Tangerang (Greater area of Jakarta), Indonesia. My working is more about back-end, some of fullstack web, system designs and architectures. I've been writing codes for several years, and as hobbyist coder too in my free time.

I create this blog to dump, share my thoughs. I hope you found this blog useful.

Thanks for visiting my blog :)
